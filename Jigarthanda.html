    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

            <strong> For the Jigarthanda</strong>
<ul>

        <li>
            1 liter full-fat milk.
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup badam pisin (almond gum).
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup nannari syrup (sarsaparilla syrup).
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup homemade vanilla ice cream (or store-bought).
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup reduced milk (paal khova or condensed milk).
        </li>

        <br />
</ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong> Preparing the Badam Pisin (Almond Gum):</strong> <br />
                Soak the badam pisin in a bowl of water overnight. It will swell up and become jelly-like.
                Drain off any excess water and keep the soaked badam pisin aside.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <strong>Preparing the Milk:</strong> <br />
                Boil the full-fat milk in a heavy-bottomed pan until it reduces to about 3/4th of its original volume.
                Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom.
                Add the sugar to the milk and stir until it dissolves completely.
                Allow the milk to cool down to room temperature, then refrigerate it until it's well-chilled.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>
                <strong>Assembling the Jigarthanda:</strong> <br />
                Take a tall glass and add 2-3 tablespoons of soaked badam pisin (almond gum) at the bottom.
                Add 2-3 tablespoons of nannari syrup over the badam pisin.
                Pour the chilled milk over the syrup and gum mixture, filling the glass about three-quarters full.
                Add a generous dollop of reduced milk or paal khova on top of the milk.
                Finally, top it off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>

                Indian drink.
