    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Marinate the Mutton:</strong> <br />
            In a large bowl, combine the mutton pieces with curd, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric
            powder, coriander powder, fennel powder, black pepper powder, salt, and lemon juice.
            Mix well to coat the mutton evenly with the spices. Cover and let it marinate for at least 2 hours, or
            preferably overnight in the refrigerator for enhanced flavor.

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> <br />
            Wash the seeraga samba rice thoroughly in water until it runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 20
            minutes, then drain and set aside.
        </li>

        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Mutton:</strong> <br />
            Heat ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan or pressure cooker over medium heat.
            Add bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom, star anise, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and black
            peppercorns. Saut√© until the spices release their aroma.
            Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown.
            Add the slit green chilies and chopped tomatoes, and cook until the tomatoes become soft and mushy.
            Add the marinated mutton to the pan. Cook until the mutton browns slightly and releases its juices.
            Add the chopped mint and coriander leaves. Stir well and cook for a few minutes.
            Sprinkle garam masala powder over the mutton mixture and mix thoroughly.
            Pour in 4 cups of water and add salt to taste. Stir well.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Biryani:</strong> <br />
            If using a pressure cooker, close the lid and cook for 3-4 whistles on medium heat, or until the mutton
            is
            tender.
            If using a regular pot, cover and cook on medium heat until the mutton is tender, about 25-30 minutes.
            Once the mutton is cooked, add the soaked and drained seeraga samba rice to the mutton mixture. Mix
            gently
            to combine.
            Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 15-20 minutes, until the rice is fully
            cooked
            and the water is absorbed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Final Steps:</strong> <br />
            Once the rice is cooked, remove the biryani from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes, covered.
            Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving, ensuring the rice grains remain separate.
        </li>
