    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Mutton Mixture:</strong> <br />
            Dry roast the fennel seeds, cumin seeds, and black peppercorns in a pan until they release a
            fragrant aroma. Let them cool, then grind them into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or spice
            grinder.
            In a mixer or food processor, grind the roasted chana dal to a fine powder and set it aside.
            In the same mixer, add the grated coconut, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, mint leaves, and
            coriander leaves. Grind this mixture into a coarse paste.
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced mutton, ground spice powder, ground chana dal, and the
            coconut-herb paste. Add chopped onions, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, and
            salt.
            Mix all the ingredients thoroughly to form a uniform mixture. If the mixture feels too wet, you can
            add a little more roasted chana dal powder to adjust the consistency.
            Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for at least 30 minutes to help the flavors meld and make
            the mixture easier to handle.

        <li>
            <strong>Shape the Kola Urandai:</strong> <br />
            Once the mixture has rested, take small portions of it and roll them into smooth, round balls (about
            the size of a lime). Ensure the balls are compact and free of cracks.
        </li>

        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the Kola Urandai:</strong> <br />
            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.
            Once the oil is hot, carefully drop the mutton balls into the oil, a few at a time, without
            overcrowding the pan.
            Fry the balls until they turn golden brown and crispy on the outside. This should take about 5-7
            minutes.
            Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried mutton kola urandai and drain them on a paper towel to
            remove excess oil.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong>Serving Suggestions:</strong> <br />
            Serve Mutton Kola Urandai hot as an appetizer or as a side dish with rice and rasam.
            You can also pair it with a spicy chutney or sauce of your choice.
